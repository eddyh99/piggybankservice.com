                            blockchain and it uses SECC (SMART ELECTRONIC CREDIT CERTIFICATE), developed by MONEY
                            INDUSTRIAL FACTORY on NP and issued by PBS Online which converts FIAT by capitalizing the
                            SECC 1: 1 with the currency on which it is pegged to offer a cheaper and faster alternative
                            to normal Stable coins such as Tether and others and with greater security and transparency
                            than the complicated Smart Contracts that run on Etherium and on the others blockchain.<br>
                            NP is a brand new decentralized and distributed storage system, designed and built as a
                            neural network and not as a chain. This makes it immune to attacks by 51% and solves the
                            main problems of blockchain technology; this technology has come to completion after more
                            than 5 years of research and development.

                            is the solution for:</h2>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The problem of scalability, the first major problem that afflicts the old blockchain
                                technology ;</li>

                            <li>Optimizing speed and reduce transaction costs;</li>
                            <li>An ecological system because it has low energy consumption, without losing any of the
                                strengths of traditional blockchain.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            NP eliminates the figure of miners and ensures that this system is decentralized and truly
                            distributed on a large scale and not in the hands of a few large companies, as happens with
                            the main cryptocurrencies. This also allows us to replace the PoW, PoS or PoA with more
                            modern, secure consensus mechanisms that are not subject to hashrate attacks, minimizing
                            transaction costs and energy consumption, using the double ring cryptographic signature,
                            protocol gossip to gossip and bulletproof. All this has been made possible starting from a
                            DHT Framework previously used by the most famous P2P platforms (NAPSTER, eMule, BitTorre,
                            WinMX, etc.) rewritten from scratch in Golang and rusty, with direct acyclic graph,
                            effectively making double spending impossible.<br>
                            NP is 100% anonymous, no data will be recorded or saved on an external source, but only an
                            encrypted SHA256 file.log saved exclusively on your device is created; this will make it
                            impossible for anyone to connect a user to their wallet, even with forensic techniques, and,
                            through the implementation of CryptoNote, it will be impossible for anyone to see balances
                            and transactions, except for the user himself. NP has a different concept of the block,
                            compared to traditional blockchains, where the block carries within it all the historical
                            data, since its creation, making the blockchain increasingly heavy, while in NP the block
                            will carry with it alone essential data and the last change of ownership so as not to become
                            heavy and remain lean and fast, secure and resilient, without servers or blockchain<br>
                            NP is the only one not to have a native coin as it was conceived and built to be the basis
                            of what will be the evolution of smart contracts or tokens and to be able to manage them
                            simultaneously on a single network at a single level.<br>
                            Money Industrial Factory has developed SECC (smart electronic credit certificate) on NP,
                            intelligent electronic credit certificates, which are intelligent Stable Coins created by
                            merging Token and Smart Contract. This technology allows you to have a change of ownership
                            of a value, data or file in a safe and anonymous way without having to perform what is
                            called a transaction, but only by replacing the owner of the value, gaining speed with a
                            huge saving in computing power.<br>
                            NP, being a decentralized and distributed storage system, which arises from a P2P, does not
                            lose the quality and functionality of the basic project, remaining able to manage in
                            addition to transactions also Dapp, name domain, streaming video and file sharing of any
                            like, anonymously. Safe and non-obscurable as it is impossible to shut down a large-scale
                            and decentralized distributed system.<br>
                            NP solves the scalability problem by transforming each user into a validating node every
                            time he performs an operation, thus giving double the necessary computing power.<br>
